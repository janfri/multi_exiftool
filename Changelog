0.16.0
Add option to use config files.

0.15.0
Make multi_exiftool work with Ruby 1.9 again.

0.14.1
Fix two typos.

0.14.0
Improve api for batch processing.

0.13.0
Implement batch processing to allow to write different values to multiple file
with only one call of the ExifTool command-line application.
Update documentation.

0.12.0
Implement Values#respond_to_missing?.
Improve documentation and fix example code.

0.11.0
New method Values#has_tag? to check if a tag is present.
Handle invalid values for timestamps and rationals: Timestamps where month or
day is zero (i.e. 0000:00:00 00:00:00) are converted to nil. Strings of the
form n/0 are not interpreted as rational value and are not converted.

0.10.0
Values#convert is now a public method. So you can simply adapt the value
conversion to your needs.


0.9.1
Fix bug in handling of timestamps with fractions of second introduced in
version 0.6.0. Thanks to Andrew Kendall for reporting and analyzing.

0.9.0
Add method MultiExiftool.delete_values.

0.8.0
Add MultiExiftool::VERSION.
Rename method Values#parse_value -> convert and add parameter tag to allow tag
based conversions.
So PartOfSet and Track values are not longer converted to Rational.  Fix a
really big bug in test suite: Would always pass because run_in_temp_dir was
broken, so the block was never executed. Therefor 46 assertions were not
executed since version 0.7.0. Many thanks to szTheory for this great catch!

0.7.0
Use Dir.tmpdir instead of test/temp for tests which manipulates images.
Update to rim 2.15.
Adapt development dependencies.

0.6.1
Upgrade to rim version 2.10.0 to unfreeze gemspec.

0.6.0
Handle UTC timestamps.
Support timestamps with fractions of second.

0.5.0
New methods Values#to_h and #to_hash.
Values#tags gives now an array instead of a set.

Nothing new, 0.4.1 was broken.

0.4.1
Adding gemspec file.

0.4.0
New method Values#tags to get access to unmodified tag names.
Directly sending parameters to stdin of exiftool to make it
work on windows with umlauts in filenames (Many thanks to
Claudius Coenen for the research, implementing and testing the
idea!).
Complete rewrite of the test suite to use real tests.
Allow to set tags as single value.
A lot of internal refactoring.

0.3.0
New functional api.
Update documentation.
Adding tests and new example for functional api.
Switching to rim.

0.2.0
Support writing to specific group with hash hierarchy.
Support array-like values for tags like keywords.

0.1.3
Improve README and adapt project URL.

0.1.2
Preserve time zone in time objects (don't convert to local zone).
Thanks to Bernard aka gittycat for the hint.
